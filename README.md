# How do I approach designing software?
  * What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    All of the design skills that I have worked on for my project are new skills that this class has taught me. The use of OpenGL's shaders, meshes, textures, lighting, and motion are all newly crafted skills that I hope to use more.
  * What design process did you follow for your project work?
    Throughtout my use of OpenGL I used the process of initialization, rendering, buffers and shaders, drawing objects, user input, and error handling.
  * How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    In the future, following the same design process that I used in this project, which allowed me to build on top of the last step, will make my code and scenes more seamless and easier to control.
# How do I approach developing programs?
  * What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    I have no experience in rendering, buffers, and shaders until this term so this is a new step in the design process that I used in this project.
  * How did iteration factor into your development?
    The abilitiy to use iteration allowed for me to use keyboard input for the user, track my mouse, switch persepctives, and allow for reliable repetitive code.
  * How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    Throughout the milestones my code evolved in a way that allowed for easier changes to my code later in the project. The development of a simple object, adding texture, camera movement, and texturing in a defined order allowed for the constant corrections to my code   
    and allowed for a better product for the final project.
# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    My future educational pathway includes web design and full stack development which will include 3D rendering, texturing scenes, and has given me a better coding process that has made it easier to change and debug.
  * How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
    My professional pathway is similar to my future educational pathway. I want to be involved in mobile app development and the building of the environments, ability to have user input with more complex manners, and creating a world of realism is something that will be 
    challenging but will be crucial to finding a job in the future.
